Frogger is an arcade game introduced in 1981. This game is a clone of the original game. The object of the game is to direct the player (the prince) safely across the path to the water. To do this, he must avoid the enemies (bugs) while crossing. Skillful players may obtain some bonuses along the way. The game is regarded as a classic from the golden age of video arcade games and was noted for its novel gameplay and theme. In this game the prince can collect gems for extra bonus and save the princess from the bugs to collect a large bonus. The game also has an audio player (listen to some classical music), and a background. Comments are made in the files to explain the various features. I have also included a function to render the game on mobile devices. It is not perfect, but does the job okay.
